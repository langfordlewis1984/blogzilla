          So, you think you have what it takes to get in touch with the King of
          the Monsters? Well, let's see if you can handle my mighty virtual
          presence. If you dare to send me a message, do so with a tremble of
          respectâ€”or else!

          Choose your words wisely, for my colossal intellect demands attention.
          Whether you wish to discuss my epic battles, offer tribute in the form
          of Godzilla-sized pizzas, or just share your admiration for my scaly
          greatness, make sure your subject line is as attention-grabbing as my
          atomic breath.

          Inscribe your message below, and tread lightly, for this digital realm
          cannot fully contain my ferocity. Keep it brief, and don't even think
          about spamming me with mere mortal nonsense. I've got towering
          monsters to wrestle, you know!

          Include your email, and perhaps I'll consider your plea worthy of my
          time. I might just spare you from a little tail swipe if your words
          are compelling enough.

          Human Verification: Show Respect

        <p className="ml-10 max-w-sm">
          Before you press that ominous &quot;Submit&quot; button, prove your
          worth by completing a simple human verification. After all, I am not

          And there you have it, weakling! Hit that button and unleash your
          words upon the digital void. If I'm in a generous mood, I might grant
          you a response. But remember, my time is precious, and I have cities
          to stomp.

          words quake with awe!
